# MakersBnB

Production site: https://makersbnb6ever.herokuapp.com.

## Overview

MakersBnb is an application designed to allow a host to list spaces available and for guests to book those spaces. It was written in 4 days as the first group project during week 6 at Makers Academy. In order to increase the challenge we decided to use Rails as the core technology for the product as this was a new framwework we were all keen to learn.

## Technology stack

- Ruby on Rails: Core web application framework
- Postgresql: Database
- RSpec with Capybara: Testing
- BCrypt: Password hashing and security
- Travis: Continuous Integration
- Github: Source control
- Heroku: Hosting of staging and production environments

## Local install

When locally installing for development first ensure you have postgresql installed (https://www.postgresql.org/download/) then:

```
git clone https://github.com/david-mears/MakersBnB/
bundle install
bundle exec db:create
bundle exec db:migrate
bin/rails server
```
Then simply connect to localhost:3000 to begin using the application.

## Design

We purposefully designed the application in a RESTful manner with spaces, users, availabilities and sessions following this model.

For the design of the database schema we created the following diagram:

## Pipeline

One of the main goals of this project was to develop a working process and pipeline for collaborating as a team effectively.

Github was configured with a master and staging branch and all day-to-day changes were based on the staging branch. Individual developers could raise pull requests based on this branch with the main branches protected. To merge into staging 2 other developers were required to review the code and Travis had to successfully pass the feature and unit tests before the merge could take place.

At regular intervals, typically when a user story was completed, the staging branch was merged into master.

After each merged pull request the staging branch automatically deployed to Heroku at https://makersbnb5ever.herokuapp.com to allow the developer to perform any further manual UI checks. The master branch would automatically deploy to a production Heroku site at https://makersbnb6ever.herokuapp.com when staging changes were merged.
